# Algorithm-Design-Homework-3
Solving 4 problems using algorithm design techniques learned in class
I included a pdf file with the homework instructions in Spanish
Each problem folder contains a main.cpp file in which I wrote the descriptions of each problem.
At the beginning of each main.cpp file it indicates the complexity(worst case) of each algorithm
